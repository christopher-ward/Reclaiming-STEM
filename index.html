        <h1>Reclaiming STEM <br> 2020 <br> Workshop</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Reclaiming STEM was founded to address the need for science communication and science policy
        training spaces for people who identify as minoritized groups: BIPOC, first-generation, disabled, LGBTQIA+,
        undocumented, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We organize training for diverse scientists to learn how to communicate their science at the
        intersection of research and social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increasing diversity of scientists requires training that accounts for
        the challenges minoritized groups face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our programming seeks and invites only scientists from diverse backgrounds to
        present interactive and innovative workshops centering their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is for attendees to not only gain
        skills but also be able to identify with and envision themselves in science communication and science policy spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are extremely excited about our Virtual Workshop this Fall!
      </p>

I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of San Diego, where I teach upper-division biology courses and study the connections between disease and pollination ecology. When I am not doing research, I like to spend time with my dog, my partner, and either crafting or getting to know more about Puerto Rican culture. I love to chat with people, especially when it comes to listening to their stories and experiences. I am excited to be part of Reclaiming STEM 2020. I hope I get a chance to get to know you!</p>

        <p>Danielle Kalani Heinz is a Ph.D. candidate in Hawaiian archaeology at UCLA. Her research focuses on performing activist archaeologies through a Hawaiian culture-based framework. She examines the history of water rights in Nā Wai ʻEhā, Maui, using fossil diatoms and isotope analysis to understand how water availability changed over time as a result of plantation diversion and climate change. Recognizing the importance of kulāiwi (homeland) to Native Hawaiians, she also conducts phytolith analysis to understand if Hawaiians started growing different plants to survive on their kulāiwi amidst water diversion. This project is especially close to her heart because this region is the home of her ancestors and because this research allows her to reconnect to this ʻāina (land) as a diasporic Hawaiian. She hopes to use this data to influence water management policies in Hawaiʻi, providing more water to taro farms, in order to help reestablish food sovereignty in Hawaiʻi.</p>

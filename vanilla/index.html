        <h1>Reclaiming STEM <br> 2020 <br> Workshop</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Reclaiming STEM was founded to address the need for science communication and science policy
        training spaces for people who identify as minoritized groups: BIPOC, first-generation, disabled, LGBTQIA+,
        undocumented, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We organize training for diverse scientists to learn how to communicate their science at the
        intersection of research and social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increasing diversity of scientists requires training that accounts for
        the challenges minoritized groups face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our programming seeks and invites only scientists from diverse backgrounds to
        present interactive and innovative workshops centering their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is for attendees to not only gain
        skills but also be able to identify with and envision themselves in science communication and science policy spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are extremely excited about our Virtual Workshop this Fall!

        <p>I (she/hers) was born and raised in Puerto Rico. In 2013 I moved from Puerto Rico to complete my Ph.D. in Ecology and
        Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine. I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of San
        Diego, where I teach upper-division biology courses and study the connections between disease and pollination ecology.
        When I am not doing research, I like to spend time with my dog, my partner, and either crafting or getting to know more
        about Puerto Rican culture. I love to chat with people, especially when it comes to listening to their stories and
        experiences. I am excited to be part of Reclaiming STEM 2020. I hope I get a chance to get to know you!</p>

        <h3>Kalani Heinz</h3>
        <p>Danielle Kalani Heinz is a Ph.D. candidate in Hawaiian archaeology at UCLA. Her research focuses on performing activist
        archaeologies through a Hawaiian culture-based framework. She examines the history of water rights in Nā Wai ʻEhā, Maui,
        using fossil diatoms and isotope analysis to understand how water availability changed over time as a result of
        plantation diversion and climate change. Recognizing the importance of kulāiwi (homeland) to Native Hawaiians, she also
        conducts phytolith analysis to understand if Hawaiians started growing different plants to survive on their kulāiwi
        amidst water diversion. This project is especially close to her heart because this region is the home of her ancestors
        and because this research allows her to reconnect to this ʻāina (land) as a diasporic Hawaiian. She hopes to use this
        data to influence water management policies in Hawaiʻi, providing more water to taro farms,
        in order to help reestablish food sovereignty in Hawaiʻi.</p>

        <p>Kyle Marian Viterbo is an engagement producer at Science Friday. She is working to increase opportunities for meaningful
        connections between our mission and the diverse audiences we serve. As a former physical anthropologist turned science
        communicator, Kyle loves sharing hilarious stories about human evolution, hidden museum collections, and the many ways
        Indiana Jones is a terrible archaeologist. Before joining the SciFri team, Kyle worked with Guerilla Science to bring
        science experiences to unexpected spaces. She also started “The Symposium: Academic StandUp,” a show and workshop series
        that uses sharp, socially-mindful comedy to challenge academic norms and champion inclusive science communication. While
        gaining an MSc in Science Communication and Public Engagement from the University of Edinburgh, she fell in love with
        stand-up comedy and has been using it ever since to understand how moments of laughter connect all of us.</p>

        (e.g., stigma, culture). Karen is also an advocate for mental health and diversity (including those who are disabled!)
        in higher education, which was why she was drawn to the Reclaiming STEM workshop and is very honored to sit on the
        Disabled in STEM panel. When she is not busy being a graduate student, she enjoys painting, reading, and volunteering.</p>

        <h3>Megan Lynch</h3>
        <p>Megan Lynch is a Masters student in Horticulture & Agronomy at UC Davis. She started her ongoing carob research in
        community college. Her Masters project is on bud development in almond. Repeated bouts with institutional ableism
        inspired the founding of UC Access Now, an equity & justice campaign for disabled students/staff/faculty at the
        University of California that has evolved into a coalition. She runs Reclaiming STEM’s Academic Secret Menu working
        group Twitter account. Somehow in all this she’s working on launching a plant breeding podcast called Breeding Rainbow.
        She’d like to work in fruit breeding and germplasm conservation, particularly in Scandinavia. And if there’s such a
        thing as work/life balance, she’d like to shoehorn getting back to art and music again in there somewhere.</p>

        <h3>Maria Montchal</h3>
        <p>I earned my PhD at UC Irvine in neuroscience, researching how memory works in humans. Some of my favorite experiences in
        grad school involved mentoring students and doing science outreach and education. This helped me realize that I wanted
        to do something to help people more directly after grad school, which led me to science policy. I’m currently a Science
        Fellow with the California Council on Science and Technology (CCST) in Sacramento, placed in the Senate Environmental
        Quality Committee. I have loved the challenge of switching from neuroscience to learning about California’s
        environmental policy landscape, and I’m excited to talk to everyone at Reclaiming STEM!</p>

        <p>Ti’Era is a third-year doctoral student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She is an informal STEM
        educator and works with historically marginalized, middle-school aged youth. She works in informal makerspaces at a
        local Boys and Girls Club and refugee center. Ti’Era’s current research interests include creating spaces where
        historically marginalized youth feel that they can bring their whole authentic selves and engage in science learning in
        ways that have traditionally been overlooked. Ti’Era also looks at issues of diversity and inclusion in environmental
        education by examining socio-historical narratives of why different races have not seen themselves as "outdoorsy" and
        why we should disrupt that narrative. She is also a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Perú) and is a certified

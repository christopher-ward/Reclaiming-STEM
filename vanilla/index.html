        <h1>Reclaiming STEM <br> 2020 <br> Workshop</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        Reclaiming STEM was founded to address the need for science communication and science policy
        training spaces for people who identify as minoritized groups: BIPOC, first-generation, disabled, LGBTQIA+,
        undocumented, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        We organize training for diverse scientists to learn how to communicate their science at the
        intersection of research and social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increasing diversity of scientists requires training that accounts for
        the challenges minoritized groups face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our programming seeks and invites only scientists from diverse backgrounds to
        present interactive and innovative workshops centering their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is for attendees to not only gain
        skills but also be able to identify with and envision themselves in science communication and science policy spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are extremely excited about our Virtual Workshop this Fall!

        <p>I (she/hers) was born and raised in Puerto Rico. In 2013 I moved from Puerto Rico to complete my Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine. I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of San Diego, where I teach upper-division biology courses and study the connections between disease and pollination ecology. When I am not doing research, I like to spend time with my dog, my partner, and either crafting or getting to know more about Puerto Rican culture. I love to chat with people, especially when it comes to listening to their stories and experiences. I am excited to be part of Reclaiming STEM 2020. I hope I get a chance to get to know you!</p>

        <h3>Kalani Heinz</h3>
        <p>Danielle Kalani Heinz is a Ph.D. candidate in Hawaiian archaeology at UCLA. Her research focuses on performing activist archaeologies through a Hawaiian culture-based framework. She examines the history of water rights in Nā Wai ʻEhā, Maui, using fossil diatoms and isotope analysis to understand how water availability changed over time as a result of plantation diversion and climate change. Recognizing the importance of kulāiwi (homeland) to Native Hawaiians, she also conducts phytolith analysis to understand if Hawaiians started growing different plants to survive on their kulāiwi amidst water diversion. This project is especially close to her heart because this region is the home of her ancestors and because this research allows her to reconnect to this ʻāina (land) as a diasporic Hawaiian. She hopes to use this data to influence water management policies in Hawaiʻi, providing more water to taro farms, in order to help reestablish food sovereignty in Hawaiʻi.</p>

        <p>Robin D. López (He/Him/His) is currently a PhD Scholar in Environmental Science, Policy, & Management at UC Berkeley. Prior to UC Berkeley, he earned a Masters (San Jose State University), Bachelors (San Francisco State University) and Associate degrees (Contra Costa College), while working as a researcher for the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Part of his philosophy in navigating academia is embracing the many failures that lead to major accomplishments, while being a voice for social and racial justice via the lens of science.</p>

        <h3>Kyle Marian Viterbo</h3>
        <p>Kyle Marian Viterbo is an engagement producer at Science Friday. She is working to increase opportunities for meaningful connections between our mission and the diverse audiences we serve. As a former physical anthropologist turned science communicator, Kyle loves sharing hilarious stories about human evolution, hidden museum collections, and the many ways Indiana Jones is a terrible archaeologist. Before joining the SciFri team, Kyle worked with Guerilla Science to bring science experiences to unexpected spaces. She also started “The Symposium: Academic StandUp,” a show and workshop series that uses sharp, socially-mindful comedy to challenge academic norms and champion inclusive science communication. While gaining an MSc in Science Communication and Public Engagement from the University of Edinburgh, she fell in love with stand-up comedy and has been using it ever since to understand how moments of laughter connect all of us.</p>

        <p>Alyssa Paparella (she/her) is a first-year graduate student at Baylor College of Medicine and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP) recipient. Alyssa graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 2019 and then completed a NIH-PREP (Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program) year at University of California, Davis. Alyssa also serves on the Advisory Council for Disability:IN’s NextGen Program. During the start of the pandemic, Alyssa was inspired to create a movement called DisabledInSTEM (check out @DisabledSTEM on Twitter) to make conversations of diversity in STEM include those with disabilities. Through this initiative, Alyssa has created a mentorship program and conducted interviews with people at various stages of their careers to highlight the diversity within the
        DisabledInSTEM community. Using her platform, Alyssa hopes to make STEM more inclusive for all.</p>

Her research includes evaluating chemical species from wildfire plumes at NASA and will work on understanding the structure of the stratosphere using trace gases. Ariana's academic journey was not completely "normal" due to struggling with mental illnesses. Based on her experiences as queer disabled Latinx woman in science, she has been advocating for inclusion and accessibility for disabled folks within the STEM community and academia. In her free time, she likes to ice skate, create art, hike, and collect Star Wars fantasy pins.</p>

        <h3>Megan Lynch</h3>
        <p>Megan Lynch is a Masters student in Horticulture & Agronomy at UC Davis. She started her ongoing carob research in community college. Her Masters project is on bud development in almond. Repeated bouts with institutional ableism inspired the founding of UC Access Now, an equity & justice campaign for disabled students/staff/faculty at the University of California that has evolved into a coalition. She runs Reclaiming STEM’s Academic Secret Menu working group Twitter account. Somehow in all this she’s working on launching a plant breeding podcast called Breeding Rainbow. She’d like to work in fruit breeding and germplasm conservation, particularly in Scandinavia. And if there’s such a thing as work/life balance, she’d like to shoehorn getting back to art and music again in there somewhere.</p>
